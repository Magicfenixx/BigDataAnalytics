Data Collection: Automated scripts to fetch data from TMDB, ensuring a live and relevant dataset.
Data Engineering: Techniques such as normalization, feature extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.
Model Training: Application of linear regression to establish a baseline for comparison and polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships.
Evaluation: Use statistical measures to evaluate the models’ performance and the strength of the correlation.
Expected Outcome: The project aims to reveal patterns and insights that could help understand the factors contributing to a movie’s success and the predictive power of ratings on popularity.
