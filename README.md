1.1	Objective: 

To investigate the relationship between the popularity of movies and their ratings, and to determine the extent to which movie quality influences audience and critical reception.

1.2 Scope
Data Collection: Automated scripts to fetch data from TMDB, ensuring a live and relevant dataset.

Data Engineering: Techniques such as normalization, feature extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Training: Application of linear regression to establish a baseline for comparison and polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships.

Evaluation: Use statistical measures to evaluate the models’ performance and the strength of the correlation.

Expected Outcome: The project aims to reveal patterns and insights that could help understand the factors contributing to a movie’s success and the predictive power of ratings on popularity.
